My name is Sermin and I’m an English teacher living in Sydney. I have been teaching high quality English lessons since 2014. My English lessons have helped learners from all over the world to become better language users.

Studying English online is a great way to improve your language skills or to maintain the skills that you have learned abroad. It’s convenient because you can study from home or anywhere via computer. However, it’s more than that, studying with me means you can focus exactly on your learning needs with an experienced language teacher who will help you to improve your English skills.

I work full-time as an English teacher, but I also teach online because I’m passionate about working with new and former students from all over the world to help them achieve their dreams.  I don’t see my job as work but as pure enjoyment!

If you want a teacher who believes in making English lessons fun, interesting and challenging, then I’m right for you. I put all my effort into creating personalised lessons for my students. I believe in having a positive, supportive relationship with all my students and they will all tell you how patient I am as a teacher. I want my learners to be at ease, to make mistakes and fall in love with learning English.
